This project was originally meant to be an exploration of backtracking, however it was quickly realized that pure backtracking the [knight's tour problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour) would be extremely inefficient in regards to runtime. Becuase of this realization, the algorithm has been switched to the Warnsdorff's Heuristic to reduce runtime to linear time. Although both implementations are in the project, only Warnsdorff's Heuristic is used in the final project.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
